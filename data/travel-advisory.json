Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine\/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards. On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government\u2019s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into later stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; prohibition of movement to secondary home. This remains the status for much of the country. Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 10 people allowed; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there will be no more mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 50 people; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 50 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and caf\u00e9s allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Curfew and cordon sanitaire dependent on local authority decision; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75\u2019s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Re-opening of borders.\nStage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed.

Its use is voluntary, but the Government has underlined that its effectiveness will depend on how many download and use it. The App is built on the framework developed by Apple and Google. It uses Bluetooth technology to create a record of codes sent on a continuous basis by devices using the App. When two users enter in close contact with each other, their devices exchange their random codes, recording the contact in the device memory. The random codes are transferred to a server located in Italy and managed by the Ministry of Health. If one user tests positive for Covid-19, this information is voluntarily sent to the server and from there downloaded on all the devices where the App is installed. The App will notify the users with \u201cmatching\u201d codes of the risk of infection and provide recommendations. To read more about the App, including FAQs, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.immuni.italia.it\/\">Immuni<\/a> official website (available in Italian, English, German, French, and Spanish).
